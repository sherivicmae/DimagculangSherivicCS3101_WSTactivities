## 🗓️ Lab 1: Class Schedule
### Overview
In this lab, I created a class schedule using HTML only. It displays weekly classes in a structured table format, highlighting class codes, descriptions, and timings. The project demonstrates the usage of semantic tags, styling, and table attributes.

### Important Tags Used
- <table>: Used to create the class schedule layout.
- <tr>: Defines each row of the table.
- <td> and <th>: Represents table cells and headers.
- <style>: Includes CSS styling directly in the HTML document.
- <footer>: Adds additional information about the class schedule at the bottom.
- @import: Imports fonts from Google Fonts for a visually appealing design.

Preview
The schedule includes:
🕒 Timings (e.g., 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM).
📖 Class Codes and Descriptions (e.g., IT 321 - Human-Computer Interaction).
🎨 Styled Table Borders and Header Colors.
