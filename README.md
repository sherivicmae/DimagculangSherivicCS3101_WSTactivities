## 🗓️ Lab 1: Class Schedule

### Overview
In this lab, I created a class schedule using **HTML only**. It displays weekly classes in a structured table format, highlighting class codes, descriptions, and timings. The project demonstrates the use of semantic tags, styling, and table attributes.

### 📌 Important Tags Used
- `<table>`: Creates the class schedule layout.
- `<tr>`: Defines each row of the table.
- `<td>` and `<th>`: Represents table cells and headers.
- `<style>`: Includes CSS styling directly in the HTML document.
- `<footer>`: Adds additional information about the class schedule at the bottom.
- `@import`: Imports fonts from Google Fonts for a visually appealing design.
