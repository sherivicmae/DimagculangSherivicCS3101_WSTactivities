    <h1>Symbiosis Relationships</h1>
    <ol type="I">
      <li><h3>Mutualism</h3></li>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>
          <strong>Definition</strong>
        </li>
        <ul type="define">
          <li>
            type of symbiotic relationship where both participating organisms
            benefit from the interaction
          </li>
          <li>
            the association provides advantages to each partner that they would
            not be able to achieve independently
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Real-life examples</strong></li>
        <ul type="example">
          <li>
            Bees and Flowers: Bees collect nectar from flowers for food and, in
            the process, transfer pollen that aids in plant reproduction,
            benefiting both parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Oxpeckers and Large Herbivores: Oxpeckers feed on ticks and
            parasites from large herbivores, providing the birds with a meal and
            giving the herbivores relief from pests.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <li><h3>Commensalism</h3></li>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>
          <strong>Definition</strong>
        </li>
        <ul type="define">
          <li>
            type of symbiotic relationship where one organism benefits from the
            interaction while the other organism is neither helped nor harmed.
          </li>
          <li>
            the benefiting organism gains an advantage, such as food, shelter,
            or transportation, without significantly affecting the other
            organism involved.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Real-life examples</strong></li>
        <ul type="example">
          <li>
            Remoras and Sharks: Remoras attach to sharks and feed on leftover
            food scraps, benefiting from easy access to food while the sharks
            remain unaffected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Barnacles and Whales: Barnacles attach to whales and capture
            plankton as the whale swims, benefiting from nutrient-rich water
            while the whale experiences little impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <li><h3>Parasitism</h3></li>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>
          <strong>Definition</strong>
        </li>
        <ul type="define">
          <li>
            type of symbiotic relationship where one organism, the parasite,
            benefits at the expense of the other organism, the host
          </li>
          <li>
            the parasite derives resources or advantages from the host, often
            causing harm or distress to it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Real-life examples</strong></li>
        <ul type="example">
          <li>
            Ticks and Mammals: Ticks feed on the blood of mammals like dogs and
            deer, benefiting from the nutrient-rich blood while causing
            discomfort and potential health issues to the host.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tapeworms and Intestinal Animals: Tapeworms reside in the intestines
            of animals, such as cows or humans, absorbing nutrients from the
            hostâ€™s digested food and potentially causing malnutrition and
            digestive problems.
